# Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC)
This repository contains code to perform secondary analysis of large-scale international assessment & survey data obtained from PIAAC, a worldwide study by the OECD in 24 countiries of cognitive and workplace skills. This projext is interested in factors associated with full-time professionals problem-solving skills (PS-TRE) as measured by PIAAC, especially work-related experiences such as the type and intensity of skills use at work, as well as participation in adult education and training (AET) programs.Eligible repondents were 8,535 full-time professionals from the 14 selected countries and six occupational categories who were at least 25 years old at the time of the survey.

The analysis is done in three parts: 
EDA provides an overview of the data management, including the inclusion criteria; 
Prediction models the relationships between the type and intensity of skills use at work & full-time professionals' PS-TRE;
Propensity Score estimates the treatment effects of formal & non-formal AET programs.

Public use files containing individual unit record data are available for downloading in SAS, SPSS, and Excel format at http://www.oecd.org/skills/piaac/publicdataandanalysis/. Tese contain both responses to the background questionnaire and the cognitive assessment.
